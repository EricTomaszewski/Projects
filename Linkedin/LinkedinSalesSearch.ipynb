Ma quête d’apprentissage m’a amené au brésil afin d’approfondir mes connaissances. J’ai profité de cette occasion pour étudier à l’université fédérale de Rio de Janeiro en science économique, ce qui m’a conduit à m’intéresser encore plus aux enjeux sociaux-économiques au Brésil.\n",
      "Ainsi lorsque j’ai été amené à m’entrainer avec les jeunes exceptionnels du projet social Cantagalo Jiu-Jitsu de la Favela Cantagalo à Rio de Janeiro, j’ai vite compris que ces petits auraient besoin d’aide pour atteindre leurs rêves et espérer une autre vie que celle que la société pouvait leur offrir.\n",
      "Après avoir financé des compétitions sur mes fonds personnels, je me suis dit qu’il fallait faire quelque chose de plus durable afin de pouvoir poser des actions concrètes et pérennes pour ces jeunes. De là est née le Projet Afrobraz/Afrobraz Project. Mon goût pour la mode a permis de lancer le projet avec des collections de t-shirts et sweatshirts , dont tous les bénéfices issus de la vente me permettent de financer partiellement les jeunes de Rio. Cette année, nous avons réussi à accompagner 6 jeunes au championnat européen de Jiu Jitsu Brésilien à Paris et obtenu 5 médailles d’or et une médaille de bronze! \n",
      "Un jour, un des jeunes m’a posé la question suivante : « pourquoi tu nous aides alors que tu ne nous connais pas (depuis longtemps)? »\n",
      "à ça j’ai répondu : « Parce que je peux! » \n",
      "J’ai l’immense conviction que chaque petit acte peut faire une différence dans la vie d’une personne.

In particular, need for more scale-up capital for innovations like clean hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, next-gen nuclear, CO2 removal/capture can be too capital-intensive and long-term for early stage funding (grants, VC), and too risky for late-stage funding (project financing, PE, infra investment).\n",

On average, the GCF approved US$76 million in Pacific projects each year from 2015 (when the GCF was operationalised) to 2020 (the latest year of comparative climate finance data from the OECD). The Green Environment Facility and the Climate Investment Funds are also among the top ten climate finance providers in the Pacific, with the Adaptation Fund coming in at sixteenth.\n",
